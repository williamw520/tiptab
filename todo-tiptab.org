<b>Permissions Usage Disclosure:</b>
(This extension requires the following permissions to function properly.)
<ol>
 <li>The "tabs" permission is needed to access the properties of the tabs.</li>
 <li>The "storage" permission is needed to save settings.</li>
 <li>The "cookies" permission is needed to get the "cookieStoreId" property in a tab, which is the tab's container Id.  (Note: the "cookies" permission will cause the display of the notice, "It requires permission to: Access your data for all websites," during installation.)</li>
 <li>The "contextualIdentities" permission is required to retrieve the container information.</li>
 <li>The "sessions" permission is used to undo closed tab.</li>
 <li>The "downloads" permission is used to let user download the tab window screenshot.</li>
 <li>The "tabHide" permission is used to hide and show tabs.</li>
</ol>

<b>Information:</b>
<ul>
  <li>Ctrl+Shift+L is the default hotkey to activate Tip Tab; also for cycling through the tab focus.</li>
  <li>Ctrl+Shift+F is the default hotkey to search Tip Tab.</li>
  <li>Custom hotkeys can be set up in the Options page to override the default ones.</li>
  <li>The Options page can be brought up from Firefox's addon manager or from the dropdown menu at upper right hand corner.</li>
  <li>Reload the Tip Tab page (or the Refresh All command) to refresh all the tabs.</li>
  <li>This extension requires Firefox 61 and up.</li>
  <li>Dragging and dropping tabs across security domains (containers and normal/private windows) would only copy the tab's url and open it as new.
      The tab history and cookies are NOT copied, to maintain the security isolation of the tabs.</li>
</ul>

<b>Issues:</b>
<ul>
  <li>For keyboard navigation, the Tab key will cycle the focus through the tabs, plus onto the Firefox controls on the frame, such as the address bar, the search bar.
      Cycling the focus to outside controls is part of the normal handling on the Tab key by Firefox and cannot be changed.
      The hotkey will only cycle the focus through the tabs and Tip Tab's search field.
  </li>
</ul>
